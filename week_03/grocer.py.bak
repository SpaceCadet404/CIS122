# Program:      Lesson 2 
# Programmer:   Douglas Rosenfield
# Date:         01/16/19
# Purpose:      This program is designed to total costs of grocery items for checkout.

# create variables
apple_item = "apple"
apple_qty = 1
apple_price = 0.60
banana_item = "banana"
banana_qty = 5
banana_price = 1.5
cabbage_item = "cabbage"
cabbage_qty = 3
cabbage_price = 2.0

apple_total = (apple_qty * apple_price)
banana_total = (banana_qty * banana_price)
cabbage_total = (cabbage_qty * cabbage_price)

order_total = (apple_total + banana_total + cabbage_total)

#output

print("Order for Douglas")
print("Item Name     Price     Qty     Total")
print("1. " + str(apple_item) + " " + str(apple_price) + " " + str(apple_qty) + " " + str(apple_total))
print("2. " + str(banana_item) + " " + str(banana_price) + " " + str(banana_qty) + " " + str(banana_total))
print("3. " + str(cabbage_item) + " " + str(cabbage_price) + " " + str(cabbage_qty) + " " + str(cabbage_total))
print("Order Total: $" + str(order_total))
